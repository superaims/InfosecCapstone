# Terraform for Threat Emulation
=======
## Cybersecurity Capstone

To encourage security champions to write safer code and identify infrastructure threat vectors quickly, there is a need to quickly provision and configure sandbox environments to simulate these. This solution proposes threat emulation at scale, using infrastructure as code (IaC). Utilizing intentionally vulnerable Terraform templates and leveraging code to replicate insecure architectural patterns, security practitioners can deploy AWS cloud environments and implement secure infrastructure development best practices to mitigate risk on public cloud resources.
